## Driver_drowsiness_system_CNN
This is a system which can detect the drowsiness of the driver using CNN - Python, OpenCV

The aim of this is system to reduce the number of accidents on the road by detecting the drowsiness of the driver and warning them using an alarm. 

Here, we used Python, OpenCV, Keras(tensorflow) to build a system that can detect features from the face of the drivers and alert them if ever they fall asleep while while driving. The system dectects the eyes and prompts if it is closed or open. If the eyes are closed for 3 seconds it will play the alarm to get the driver's attention, to stop cause its drowsy.
